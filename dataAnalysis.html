<h1>Final Project: Data Analysis Application and Presentation</h1>

<h2>Step 1: data retrieval</h2>
<p>observe and choose a dataset and extract the appropriate data
  I've chosen: </p>

<h2>Step 2: Formulate one or more questions to be investigated via data analysis.</h2>
<p>Write, as English sentences, one or more questions or hypotheses that can be addressed using the data set you have selected.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use computer-based tools to analyze the data in the context of addressing your questions/hypotheses.</h2>
<p>Use any appropriate data analysis tools </p>

<h2>Step 4: Construct and publish presentations of the process and the results of analysis.</h2>
<p>published content must address both the process by which the problem was determined, data was obtained, and analysis conducted and the results of the analyses.

In addition to describing the process, details must be provided about associated sources, data sets, questions/hypotheses, downloading, formatting, analytical tools, documentation tools, and uploading.

Presentations must include both textually and graphically formatted information.  (Note that different formats can be used for different analytical results.)</p>
