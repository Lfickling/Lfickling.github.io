<h1>Final Project: Data Analysis Presentation</h1>
<h2><a href="/index.html">main page</a></h2>

<h2>Step 1: choose a data set</h2>
<p>I've chosen: The 538 datasets on world football (soccer) SPI (soccer power index).
   Specifically the spi_global_rankings csv. 
  you can find a link to that csv <a href="/soccer-spi/spi_global_rankings_intl.csv">here</a></p>

<h2>Step 2: Formulate one or more questions to be investigated via data analysis.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Is the average SPI higher on average for national teams or club teams? 
    I suspect national teams since there are so much fewer national teams. 
    But on the other hand, every country gets a national team but not every country has good footballers.</li>
  <li>Which conference has the highest average SPI and Ranking? I suspect UEFA but i wouldn't be at all shocked if it was CONMEBOL</li>
  <li>how correlated is SPI with ranking?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 3: Use computer-based tools to analyze the data in the context of addressing your questions/hypotheses.</h2>
<p>I'm using python with pandas.
  here's the <a href="/footballAnalysis.ipynb">link</a> to the ipython notebook
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Construct and publish presentations of the process and the results of analysis.</h2>
<p>published content must address both the process by which the problem was determined, data was obtained, and analysis conducted and the results of the analyses.

In addition to describing the process, details must be provided about associated sources, data sets, questions/hypotheses, downloading, formatting, analytical tools, documentation tools, and uploading.

Presentations must include both textually and graphically formatted information.  (Note that different formats can be used for different analytical results.)</p>
